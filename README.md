# Guest Configuration Project

This module is a template
to use with the
[Plaster](https://github.com/powershell/plaster)
tool for scaffolding new projects.

## Demo

## Setup

To use this solution on your dev workstation,
you will need to install the module from the
[PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com).
This is easiest to do from PowerShell.

> This tool has only been tested on PowerShell 7 preview

```powershell
Install-Module GuestConfigurationProject -repository PSGallery -force
```

This command will also install the following required modules if they
are not already available on the machine.

- Plaster
- Pester
- GuestConfiguration

This module include task runners for the
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
editor.
However, you could scaffold the project
and then open it in the editor of your choice.

## How-to use the tool

Navigate to the folder where the `GuestConfigurationProject` module is installed.
Run the command `Invoke-Plaster` with a `.` as the Template source location.
For the Destination path location,
use any folder where you would like to create a project.

Open VS Code, and open the project folder.
A small window will prompt to import the workspace.
This is optional and will not effect the functionality of the task runners.

Use the sample project to create a custom resource/configuration
according to your requirements.

When you are ready to test, use the task runners by clicking
`Terminal` and then `Run Task`.

## Task runners

The tool includes task runners that automate the steps to test
your project and create (and validate) a package to use in Azure Policy Guest Configuration.

The first step requires the Pester module.
The second and third steps require the GuestConfiguration module.

The GuestConfiguration module includes a copy of the agents used in Azure,
for both Windows and Linux, so packages can be validated from developer workstations.

- **1. Run tests (Pester)**: Runs [Pester](https://github.com/pester/pester) tests for the new project to verify functionality.
- **2. Build package**: Runs the `New-GuestConfigurationPackage` command to create a .zip package containing the configuration and custom resources from your project.
- **3. Test package**: Runs the `Test-GuestConfigurationPackage` command to validate the package by running it using the same agent that is used in Azure, from your workstation.
